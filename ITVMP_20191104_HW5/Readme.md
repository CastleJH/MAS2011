**How to Play**
1. Hold the button '1' and '2' to move the left/right joints connecting yellow arms and the body.
2. Hold the button '3' and '4' to move the left/right joints connecting cyan arms and yellow arms.
3. Hold the button '5' and '6' to move the left/right joints connecting magenta arms and cyan arms.
4. Press the button 'Space Bar' **just once** to grip the gripper automatically (up to degree 5).
5. Press the button 'Space Bar' again to release the gripper automatically (up to degree 60).
   Meaning, Space Bar for gripper works as a toggle, unlike number buttons for each joint.
